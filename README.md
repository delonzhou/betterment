# Betterment

### Learning & Knowledge Sharing Platform

**Problem this app solves:**

* Talented and skilled people are scattered around the internet and there is no easy way to contact or hire them for required job.

* Brings all the skilled people under one umbrella and makes collaboration easier.

* Chat service allows people to interact in real time.


**Examples:**

1. Jamie is an expert at Python Programming and loves to teach people how to code.People can ask him for his services and Jamie can make money by teaching something that he loves.

1. Sarah is really good at Photoshop ,she can be contacted and hired at an hourly rate just by a few clicks by using the app.
